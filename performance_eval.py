'''
Makes predictions and evaulates the models.

1. Checks for overfitting/underfitting (plotting--learning curves)
2. Computes scores for accuracy, precision, recall, and f1
3. Cross-entropy for loss function
4. Check residuals

All of these steps must be performed on all 3 models.

    ### Call the model

    ### RETURN 3 predicted classes based on user's answers.
