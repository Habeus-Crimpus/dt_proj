## Overview of the Project

Utilizing the SD3 questionnaire, a 28-question survey designed to quantify a person's relative levels of narcissistic, Machiavellian, and psychopathic traits, the app allows users to take the survey and gain insight into how their scores were within expected ranges. The app was demoed at the Le Wagon Munich Demo Day in June 2023. A video of the presentation is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJbLL8r0s6-Z8hFgd1gkpvZohidu7LwY/view.
